# Ken Langdon's Digital Kingdom 🏰

Welcome, brave traveler, to the source code of my personal website. You've stumbled upon the digital equivalent of my garage: a bit messy, full of half-finished projects, and probably a few spiders.

## What is this place?

This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that powers [kenlangdon.github.io](https://kenlangdon.github.io). It's my personal slice of the internet, where I showcase my projects, share my thoughts, and generally try to convince people I know what I'm doing.

**Warning:** This code was likely written late at night, fueled by caffeine and questionable life choices. Proceed with caution.

## Here Be Dragons 🐲

...and probably some typos. If you find a bug, it's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature. Feel free to open an issue, but be prepared for me to claim it was intentional.

## Contributing

Spotted a typo? Want to improve something? I'm open to pull requests! However, I also accept contributions in the form of:

-   Coffee ☕
-   Funny cat videos 😹
-   Tacos 🌮

Just kidding (mostly). If you want to contribute, feel free to fork the repo and submit a PR.

## A Final Word

Thanks for stopping by!
